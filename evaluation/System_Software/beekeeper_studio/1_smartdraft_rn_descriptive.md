# v4.6.2
## üêõ fix
- Added a shortcut for reopening the last closed tab using 'Ctrl+Shift+T'. Improved tab management to ensure correct placement and automatic position assignment. Refactored code to check for `workspaceId` in the `OpenTab` model and updated `TabModule` for efficient handling. Enhanced functionality to duplicate closed tabs with a new ID, ensuring the `remove` method duplicates tabs before adding them to the `lastClosedTabs` array.
