# v0.14.1
## üêõ fix
- Optimized `Transform::local_{xyz}` methods by replacing `Dir3::new` with `Dir3::new_unchecked`, eliminating unnecessary normalizations. [e941264](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/commit/e941264b6f3f44af865e0e1642e93d34e8afee65)
- Fixed potential NaN issue in AABB implementations for round shapes by clamping negative values caused by numerical errors. Improved variable names and removed unnecessary calculations for better code consistency. [0e1858b](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/commit/0e1858bc4f1a9e7664898c27d41ad19e9c651c31)
- Fixed overflow issue in `RenderLayers::iter_layers` by replacing the right shift operation with `u64::checked_shr`, preventing a panic in debug mode and an infinite iterator in release mode. Added test case `render_layer_iter_no_overflow` to ensure the fix. [728c5b9](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/commit/728c5b98d4d1530ff86801cfb521af5e4c4dd246)
- Fixed a memory leak in `TextureCache` by retaining only entries with textures. Added an `is_empty()` method to assist higher-level caches. [680c994](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/commit/680c994100db29ab77b183ee8f6539d6fe6473d6)
- Disabled GPU preprocessing on Android devices with Adreno 730 and earlier GPUs to prevent crashes. [5d9e44b](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/commit/5d9e44b9dce73ef35670212a399955988e28ccec)
- Fixed a panic when the viewport height is zero and width is non-zero, causing `prepare_bloom_textures` to create an invalid texture size. The solution avoids division by zero, resulting in a more reasonable error for the zero-size viewport. [9daf16b](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/commit/9daf16bb870ff4ae4f50a8dda9cef350bef2a791)
- Fixed a build failure when compiling `bevy_gltf` with the `dds` feature enabled by adding a missing argument in a function call within the `bevy_core_pipeline` crate and enabling the `dds` feature in `bevy_core_pipeline`. [295ed1f](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/commit/295ed1fdb4c0779da7c784b41ccc7996801eda0a)
- Fixed incorrect batching of phase items from other pipelines by ensuring an early exit when `GFBD::get_index_and_compare_data` returns None, skipping items not part of the current pipeline. Tested on various examples. [833ee3f](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/commit/833ee3f577e973a9d4c40c23c9c3ff1aee94b4c7)
- Fixed `bevy_window` build failure with `serialize` feature by adding missing `bevy_ecs/serialize` dependency. [70a0c21](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/commit/70a0c211ffcb6df7afd8ce645c43712c1d20d2e7)
- Resolved the `bevy_winit` build issue with the `serialize` feature by ensuring the `serialize` flag is passed to dependencies. Added necessary crates to the feature flag. [c4ea477](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/commit/c4ea4776c419a44bfa49ad3e7f13a675d28d8d1a)
- Fixed a breaking change from the image 0.25.2 release deprecation affecting the CI process. [27cafda](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/commit/27cafdae9b4dd31b45e234279f9b4d3857721c7f)
- Updated the minimum version of the `image` dependency for `bevy_render` to address a compilation issue. [587cffd](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/commit/587cffdcde0377a8c0191d41349f6cc26b5de372)
- Fixed an issue where repeatedly clicking the window close button could cause a panic when inserting the `ClosingWindow` component into an entity. Tested on Windows to confirm the panic no longer occurs. [3a6176b](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/commit/3a6176b6cbf0952435cb3fc47f5e21215cfb95e0)
- Fixed an issue where only the first curve was applied in animations with a single keyframe. Now, all curves are considered, even with a single keyframe. [2e577bc](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/commit/2e577bcdc9c09f18f4d06fe5f580e7ce26ff37dc)
- Fixed incorrect function calls to `hsv_to_rgb` in render debug code by correcting input parameters. [df3fcbd](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/commit/df3fcbd116fb38bdd8ee6cde2740a98290a61c86)
- Fixed a build issue in `bevy_gltf` with `pbr_multi_layer_material_textures` or `pbr_anisotropy_texture` features by adding the necessary flags in `bevy_pbr`. [2870d89](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/commit/2870d89d5ca28a1d3580d67630ee9659969cc11c)
- The `EmptyPathStream` struct is now exclusive to Android and wasm32 targets, addressing Rust nightly warnings. Modified `MorphTargetNames` for better Rust compatibility. [a6fde10](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/commit/a6fde1059c8a413b353d4f39581b09b296cd6b9a)
- StateScoped now implements Reflect and Clone, enhancing flexibility and usability in Clone Bundles. [4275669](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/commit/4275669b07492ea66d5cf09fbd0c94c8833dafac)
- Enhanced the warning message for unstyled children in the UI hierarchy to include the entity ID, simplifying debugging of entities without UI components used as children of entities with UI components. [c6b80c5](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/commit/c6b80c56644a35faad6aa7452102fa289f53ece4)
- Improved logging format for entities by removing redundant information, enhancing conciseness and readability. [7ed1f6a](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/commit/7ed1f6a9b6b24224052ae2284d01239b11824c3f)
- A temporary fix addresses the app hanging when windows are invisible on Windows OS. App updates will run regardless of the redraw call result if no windows are visible. A more robust fix is planned for the future. [4bd56b6](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/commit/4bd56b6da1362f503203b66941bdbec742ec3cd7)
- Corrected the documentation for `Rot2::rotation_to/from_y` to accurately describe the rotations, fixing previously swapped descriptions. [d0583c8](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/commit/d0583c8b5444660049a6a397604389f16323be97)
- The update modifies ObserverSystem traits to accept an `Out` parameter, allowing observer systems to have outputs. A test verifies that an observer system with a non-empty output can pipe its output into another system. [7f3fea9](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/commit/7f3fea9a5bb86a7f6a64dc45723b5c6b25a8f2e0)
- The initial `StateTransition` now runs before `PreStartup` instead of during `Startup`. [524fb01](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/commit/524fb01457378096bf08e6bc90b085816cd24844)
- Corrected an error in the SMAA shader by using the appropriate values for `d_xz` to match the original SMAA implementation. This fix ensures the shader operates as intended without major visual differences observed during testing. [42412f3](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/commit/42412f35006607db0036f16829f3e4e4d4067042)
- Updated default viewport to 1x1 size to prevent crashes from wgpu validation error. [420ca6c](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/commit/420ca6c43c2d65d822b2f2c7da5e2808af867f4c)
- The `ui_layout_system` re-syncs changed children after node removal to prevent layout glitches from removed nodes still being set as children of other nodes. Fixes an issue where docking zone highlights could glitch under certain conditions. [ebfe545](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/commit/ebfe545f796a8d5073ad25d1832a6d983cb0e9e8)
- Modified slicing checks and algorithm to fully support asymmetrical textures, tested with a custom asymmetrical texture for improved handling. [d888640](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/commit/d8886408bf1af50d4eff660e07063a5541f31bb4)
- Addressed Clippy lints and allowed certain warnings for code quality improvements. [c217238](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/commit/c217238c5e239cb7ac4d82a462c37fd24b084abf)

## ‚ú® feat
- The update allows using `bevy_input` types without `bevy_reflect`. The `bevy_reflect` feature in `bevy_input` is now optional and enabled by default. [1bc5ecd](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/commit/1bc5ecda9b1a1828b61af30149bcd40a8cde82c7)
- Added reflection attributes to `BorderRadius`, `AnimationTransitions`, `OnAdd`, `OnInsert`, and `OnRemove` for scene serialization. [6882420](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/commit/6882420c7fc674742ac1161d52198a07fdf0e444)
- Disabled the POLYGON_MODE_LINE GPU feature in examples to address WebAssembly (WASM) compatibility issues. [0886e6a](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/commit/0886e6a302e8d74254fd3ec6ede5fd483e0220b7)
- This update adds `insert_before` and `insert_startup_before` methods, enabling schedules to be added before specified schedules in the main and startup lists. These methods follow the same logic as the `insert_after` method, with adjustments for parameter naming and insertion index. [61c683f](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/commit/61c683fb6a10240424f0905598ed94e1547a8492)
