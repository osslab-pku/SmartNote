# v0.14.1

## üêõ fix
- A temporary fix addresses the app hanging when windows are invisible on Windows OS. App updates will run regardless of the redraw call result if no windows are visible. A more robust fix is planned for the future. [4bd56b6](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/commit/4bd56b6da1362f503203b66941bdbec742ec3cd7) <span style='color:grey;'>(significance=0.06)</span>
