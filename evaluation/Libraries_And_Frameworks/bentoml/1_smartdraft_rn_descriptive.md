## üìö docs
- Updated documentation images. [#4901](https://github.com/bentoml/bentoml/pull/4901) <span style='color:grey;'>(significance=0.02)</span>
- Updated the CI status badge in the documentation. [#4918](https://github.com/bentoml/bentoml/pull/4918) <span style='color:grey;'>(significance=0.02)</span>

- Updated documentation describes BentoML as a Python library for building online serving systems optimized for AI applications and model inference. Highlights include support for any model format/runtime, custom Python code, serving optimizations, task queues, batching, multi-model chains, distributed orchestration, and multi-GPU serving. [#4910](https://github.com/bentoml/bentoml/pull/4910) <span style='color:grey;'>(significance=0.01)</span>

- The documentation for HTTP behavior testing now uses the `starlette.testclient` module. This simplifies creating a test client for sending HTTP requests to a BentoML Service. Example code and instructions have been revised for a more streamlined approach to testing HTTP endpoints. [#4915](https://github.com/bentoml/bentoml/pull/4915) <span style='color:grey;'>(significance=0.01)</span>
