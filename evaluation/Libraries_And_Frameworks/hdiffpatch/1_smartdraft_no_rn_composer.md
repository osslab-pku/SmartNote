# v4.8.0
## âœ¨ feat
- The update introduces the ldefDecompressPlugin, using libdeflate for decompression speeds twice as fast as zlib. The build configuration now includes new directories and files for improved integration and compilation. The makefile and codebase have been optimized to potentially replace zlib with libdeflate, enhancing performance. The libdeflate decompressor default in hpatchz is now closed, and Xcode build configuration has been enhanced for successful builds.
