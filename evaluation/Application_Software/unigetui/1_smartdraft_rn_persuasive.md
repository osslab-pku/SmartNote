# 3.1.1
## üêõ fix
- Optimized the WinGet local source parser, renaming `LocalWingetSource` to `LocalWinGetSource` and updating the logic for identifying local sources. The parser now more accurately determines the source type based on the provided ID, improving handling for Local PC, Android Subsystem, Steam, Ubisoft Connect, and GOG. Enhances reliability and performance of local source parsing.

- Refined logic for adding package sources to prevent duplicated local package sources after reloading installed packages. Ensures correct node addition and selection based on the sources tree view state. Clears children of the local packages node when the package list is cleared. Includes minor code formatting improvements. [3952e4a](https://github.com/marticliment/UniGetUI/commit/3952e4ab260f2c59da25bb74f56c32450e7b7599) <span style='color:grey;'>(significance=0.14)</span>

- Addresses an issue where sources would not display the Package Manager name. Modifications to the `IPackageManager` and `IManagerSource` interfaces, updates to the `ManagerSource` and `PackageManager` classes to ensure source names are refreshed and displayed correctly. Minor adjustments to the `MainWindow.xaml.cs` and `AbstractPackagesPage.xaml.cs` files to improve functionality.
