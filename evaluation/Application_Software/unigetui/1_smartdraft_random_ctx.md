# 3.1.1
## üêõ fix
- Addresses a critical issue causing the Widgets server to crash. Modifies the `BuildWidgetsApi` method to format package source display names correctly and updates the `UpdatePackagesForManager` method to handle manager names and display names appropriately. [5f4027e](https://github.com/marticliment/UniGetUI/commit/5f4027e75c8e70175b82625e48e0b6d6d70e8463) 
- Fixed a crash caused by non-sources package managers loading their sources. [5abc216](https://github.com/marticliment/UniGetUI/commit/5abc21668176f649f506f112768866fe1aecae33) 
- Addressed an issue with Package Manager logs not displaying. Modified `TaskLogger` class to implement the `ITaskLogger` interface for proper logging functionality. [87bd9e1](https://github.com/marticliment/UniGetUI/commit/87bd9e14a026a2a17cec86e235ff2a3ad33b14d8) 
- Addresses duplication of local package sources after reloading installed packages. [3952e4a](https://github.com/marticliment/UniGetUI/commit/3952e4ab260f2c59da25bb74f56c32450e7b7599) 
- Addressed incorrect ItemViews rendering by modifying event handling and ensuring proper invalidation and rearrangement of the package list. [8437963](https://github.com/marticliment/UniGetUI/commit/8437963c7f98a6464ce905d10c1964b095e6023b) 
- Refined `PackageItemContainer_RightTapped` method logic. Now checks if the sender is a `PackageItemContainer` and if its `Package` property implements the `IPackage` interface before proceeding with selection and context menu display.
