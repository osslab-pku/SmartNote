# 9.1
## üìö docs

## ‚ú® feat
- This backport to the 9.x branch includes several improvements and fixes. The invite process now uses the realm attribute on PreregistrationUser, saving a database join. Added screenshots illustrate global time examples. Fixed `row_focus` synchronization with inbox rows, preventing errors when marking messages as read in another tab. Added a missing dependency in the migration script to reference the "confirmation" app correctly. Updated the "object_id" field in the "confirmation" model to use BigInteger instead of PositiveInteger, ensuring consistency and optimizing query performance. Resolved the scroll-to-bottom button issue, making it active only when the message feed is visible. Added an index to improve lookups and joins on `content_type` and `object_id` fields in the `confirmation` model. Addressed a race condition in message rendering related to thumbnail generation, ensuring thumbnails are ready when the message is rendered.
