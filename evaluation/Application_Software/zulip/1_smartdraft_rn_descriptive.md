# 9.1
## üìö docs
- Updated documentation to include instructions on restarting the server during the upgrade process. Press 'N' when prompted to restart by the `do-release-upgrade` tool and perform a manual reboot at the appropriate stage. Updated translations for multiple languages, enhancing internationalization support. Updated documentation to include dialogs shown by needrestart in version 22.04, addressing the "pending kernel upgrade" dialog (can be ignored) and the "daemons using outdated libraries" prompt (select "cancel"). Updated documentation to include supported PostgreSQL versions for the 9.x series. [#31193](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/31193) <span style='color:grey;'>(significance=0.56)</span>

## üêõ fix
- Optimized the query in the analytics module by adding a better-indexed join to the `analytics_usercount` table using `realm_id`, improving query performance. Reduced the precision of the `date_joined` field to minutes, eliminating unnecessary high-entropy data from the /register response. Improved visual consistency of modal buttons with a negative outline-offset to address gaps from subtle scaling effects. Fixed typeahead overflow when the caret in a textarea was near the screen's right edge by using tippy's mechanism to keep the tooltip within the visible boundary. Disabled controls on video previews in the lightbox. Centered the icon for copying URLs in the user profile.

## ‚ú® feat
- Optimized the invite process by using the realm on the PreregistrationUser to save a database join. Resolved a race condition in message rendering related to thumbnail generation, ensuring ImageAttachment data is locked and used within the message-sending transaction. Fixed `row_focus` synchronization in the inbox UI to prevent errors when a message is marked as read in another tab. Added an index to improve lookups and joins on `content_type` and `object_id` fields in the `confirmation` model. The migration process now correctly references the "confirmation" app by setting a dependency on its latest migration. Fixed the scroll-to-bottom button's visibility issue during narrow switches to prevent misclicks.
