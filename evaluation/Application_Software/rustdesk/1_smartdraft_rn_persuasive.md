# 1.3.0
## ‚ú® feat
- Added support for multiple clipboard formats: text, RTF, HTML, and various image formats. Enhanced clipboard functionality to detect and manage ownership, ensuring proper synchronization between host and client. Improved context management and error handling for a more robust clipboard service. [#8733](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/pull/8733) <span style='color:grey;'>(significance=0.17)</span>
- Refactored code by embedding mouce and uinput crates directly into the project. Removed external mouce dependency and integrated its functionality within the codebase. Updated uinput.rs to use the embedded mouce module for seamless mouse event handling and input management. [#8836](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/pull/8836) <span style='color:grey;'>(significance=0.11)</span>
- Refactored the MSI installer and introduced custom client properties. Added a parser argument for custom client properties and updated MSI package scripts accordingly. Modified custom actions and conditions to incorporate the new client properties, ensuring specific actions execute based on the custom client configuration. The update improves the MSI installer with support for 1/0 and Y/N values for options. It now reads previous options and registry values during upgrades or modifications. Issues with silent repair and upgrade processes have been fixed, ensuring correct handling of the install folder. The user interface better handles checkbox options and shortcut properties, reading previous values and initializing correctly.

## üêõ fix
- Improved clipboard functionality by setting formats and enabling options. Enhanced handling of clipboard permissions and ensured proper initialization and management of clipboard context. Improved clipboard functionality with fixes and refactoring: reusing IPC connections, merging content buffers, and enhancing clipboard service and IPC stream handling. Updates improve clipboard management on Windows by addressing controlled side formats and ensuring efficient data handling.

- Fixed an issue where clicking the audio permission button before authentication would send audio data. Ensured cursor position code remains unchanged since `show_remote_cursor` is false before authentication, preventing subscription. Clipboard code remains unchanged to prevent clipboard service subscription if clipboard permission is clicked before authentication and keyboard permission afterward. [#8917](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/pull/8917) <span style='color:grey;'>(significance=0.13)</span>
- Fixed custom client handling, MSI, and connection type in `res/msi/preprocess.py`. Updated default value and help description for `--conn-type`. [#8944](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/pull/8944) <span style='color:grey;'>(significance=0.13)</span>
- Introduces a feature to manage audio buffers more effectively. Sets the maximum audio buffer size to 150ms and clears the buffer if full. Addresses audio delays caused by network jitter by ensuring sufficient audio buffer during each period, preventing slow playback speeds. Resizes the audio buffer based on sample rate and channels, and clears it when full to avoid prolonged noise.

- Addresses virtual display management issues on Windows, sets default resolution to 1920x1080, and ensures proper restoration upon connection and disconnection. [#9023](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/pull/9023) <span style='color:grey;'>(significance=0.11)</span>
- Modified the `check_privacy_mode_changed` function to include `display_idx` and a reference to `CapturerInfo` as arguments, ensuring more accurate detection and handling of privacy mode changes. [#9027](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/pull/9027) <span style='color:grey;'>(significance=0.10)</span>
- Fixed window maximizing issue on multi-monitor setups. [#9038](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/pull/9038) <span style='color:grey;'>(significance=0.13)</span>
- Enhanced error reporting for privacy mode with detailed error messages for display settings changes failures. [#9111](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/pull/9111) <span style='color:grey;'>(significance=0.14)</span>
- Updated German language file to include translations for "Send clipboard keystrokes" and "network_error_tip". Added Dutch translation for "network_error_tip" message, offering clearer instructions to check network connection and retry. Updated the Ukrainian translation to include PIN-related messages for better localization and user experience. Added German translations for "Parent directory," "Resume," and "Invalid file name."
