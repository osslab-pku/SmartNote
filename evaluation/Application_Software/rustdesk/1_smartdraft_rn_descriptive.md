# 1.3.0
## ‚ú® feat
- Added support for multiple clipboard formats: text, RTF, HTML, and various image formats. Enhanced clipboard synchronization between client and server for cross-platform compatibility. Improved clipboard handling to avoid unnecessary updates and introduced clipboard ownership checks. [#8733](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/pull/8733) <span style='color:grey;'>(significance=0.17)</span>
- Refactored the project by embedding the `mouce` crate directly into the codebase, removing the external dependency. Updated the `uinput` module to utilize the embedded `mouce` code for seamless mouse event handling and management. [#8836](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/pull/8836) <span style='color:grey;'>(significance=0.11)</span>
- Refactored the MSI installer and introduced custom client properties. Added a new argument to the preprocess script for specifying custom client properties and updated MSI package files to handle these properties. Changes include conditionally setting properties and actions based on custom client properties, such as connection type. The MSI installer now supports 1/0 and Y/N for options, reads and preserves previous installation options, handles registry values better during upgrades or modifications, and improves conditions for shortcut properties. It opens files with explicit encoding and includes a new custom dialog for selecting the installation directory with options for creating desktop and start menu shortcuts.

- Introduced a "hide-tray" option to hide the system tray icon. [2f432e9](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/commit/2f432e941ddae05ce8a0603ec29791c6b79d2f17) <span style='color:grey;'>(significance=0.14)</span>
- Introduced a new script for managing users with functionalities to view, disable, enable, and delete users via API calls. Minor modification ensures URLs do not end with a slash.

## üêõ fix
- Improved clipboard functionality for Windows: reuses IPC connections, merges content buffers more efficiently, and refactored context management for better performance and reliability. Addresses clipboard issues by setting formats and enabling options. Ensures correct management and updates, especially in "server--clients" mode on Linux. Improves handling of clipboard permissions and initialization.

- Enhanced error reporting for privacy mode with detailed error messages for display settings changes failures. [#9111](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/pull/9111) <span style='color:grey;'>(significance=0.14)</span>
- Addresses virtual display management issues on Windows, sets default resolution to 1920x1080, and ensures proper restoration of display settings upon connection and disconnection. [#9023](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/pull/9023) <span style='color:grey;'>(significance=0.11)</span>
- Fixed an issue where clicking the audio permission button before authentication would send audio data. Ensured cursor position and clipboard code remain unchanged, as cursor subscription occurs post-authentication and clipboard service subscription is managed by keyboard permission checks. [#8917](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/pull/8917) <span style='color:grey;'>(significance=0.13)</span>
- Introduced a maximum audio buffer size of 150ms and functionality to clear the buffer if full. Ensures sufficient audio buffer during each period to meet the audio configuration, preventing slow playback speeds. Addresses audio delays caused by network jitter and plays extra silence data during underrun periods. [#8947](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/pull/8947) <span style='color:grey;'>(significance=0.12)</span>
- Addresses an issue with maximizing windows on multi-monitor setups. [#9038](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/pull/9038) <span style='color:grey;'>(significance=0.13)</span>
- Modified the `check_privacy_mode_changed` function to include additional parameters and updated its calls. The privacy mode check now considers the display index and captures information, enhancing accuracy and functionality.

## üîß chore
- Improved error logging for hardware codec configuration retrieval and enhanced handling of connection closed errors for secure TCP timeout scenarios.

- Improved ARM architecture support. [#8890](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/pull/8890) <span style='color:grey;'>(significance=0.17)</span>
- Disabled the build process for the RustDesk Android universal APK due to functionality issues. The RustDesk Android universal APK build workflow now runs only if the `upload-artifact` input is provided.

- Added translations for previously untranslated Dutch strings related to trusted devices, platform, days remaining, parent directory, resume, and invalid file name. Corrected a typographical error in the Spanish language file for the network error message. [#9092](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/pull/9092) [da70cbc](https://github.com/rustdesk/rustdesk/commit/da70cbcddae703e7fb80e077adbd452c078c132c) (significance=0.21, 0.13)

## üêõ fix (continued)
- Improved German translations for user interface messages, clipboard keystrokes, and network error tips. Improved Dutch translation for "network_error_tip" to provide clearer instructions for checking the network connection and retrying. Updated the Ukrainian translation to include several PIN-related strings, enhancing localization. Localization updates for the German language file: translations for "Parent directory," "Resume," and "Invalid file name."
