# v1.9.0
## ‚ú® feat
- Initial support for the -t flag added to show timing data for stages like Dial (TLS setup and BlockingDial), InvokeRPC, and total time. This data is part of the very verbose functionality. [#428](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl/pull/428)
- Support for xDS credentials now allows the use of xDS-provided certificates specified in the GRPC_XDS_BOOTSTRAP environment variable. xDS credentials are enabled only if the target address uses the xds:/// prefix, signaling the gRPC client to use an xDS server for resolving the target. This enhancement is a no-op outside the context of xDS, ensuring existing functionality remains unaffected. [#424](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl/pull/424)

## üêõ fix
- Expanded the -max-time flag documentation to clarify it sets the RPC timeout. Updated help text includes "timeout" and "deadline" for better discoverability and understanding. [#435](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl/pull/435)
- The default authority for a Unix domain socket is 'localhost' if unspecified. [#445](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl/pull/445)

## ‚ôªÔ∏è refactor
- Removed support for Go 1.9 by deleting corresponding code files and updating indentation handling logic. [7ccaf0a](https://github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl/commit/7ccaf0a21fedf97d7dd429cd75f00bc0a15a882b)
