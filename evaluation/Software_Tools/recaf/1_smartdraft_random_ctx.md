## üêõ fix
- Added support for Jadx mapping files in the mapping file dialog. [#516](https://github.com/Col-E/Recaf/pull/516) 
- Updated FileViewport text mode to use UTF-8 encoding. [#524](https://github.com/Col-E/Recaf/pull/524) 
- Introduced an "itf" suffix to invokestatic calls to indicate interface method calls, as required by the JVM verifier.
