## [2.21.14](https://github.com/Col-E/Recaf/compare/2.21.13...2.21.14) (2024-04-27)

### Important news

This update is primarily to remove the auto-updater from Recaf 2.X as the next release iterations are not compatible with the existing auto-updater schema. The last few prior updates announced that Recaf 3.X was in progress. We have since restructured significantly once more and will be going to 4.X.

For more details you can check out the 4.X branch here:
