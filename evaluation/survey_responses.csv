We still have to write the majority of the actual content so this is much more comprehensive. Changie would work well is we adhered to semantic commits more strictly, but at the moment that is too much overhead for us. So having a tool that can still pull out the overview of a commit without forcing developers to be rigid about semantic commit labelling is quite nice."
